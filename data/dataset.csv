Dear Dr; Kabal:,1
recently reviewed your paper; 'Relation,0
between exposure to environmental,0
tobacco,0
smoke and,0
"cancer in lifetime nonsmokers"" (Kabat",0
"GC, Stellman SD, Wynder EL.",0
Am,0
"Epldemiol 142(2}:141-8, 1995), and noted",0
a logical inconsistency that likely,0
"indicates & minor ertor,",0
"Specifically, in Table 2 (page 144), you",0
list the odds ratios for males for,0
exposure in,0
"childhood as 0.90 for ""yes"" (i.e-, any",0
"exposure), 1.12 for",0
smoker in the household;,0
"and 1.13 for ""2+ smokers in the",0
household_,0
These two later catcgories merely,0
partition,0
"the ""yes"" category, therefore te OR for",0
"""yes"" should be sme weig",0
average of the,0
OR's for the,0
sub-categories and should fall between,0
"1,12 &nd 1.13",0
"This js,",0
"unfortunately, not true in the published",0
"table, thus one or more of the OR must,",0
"believe,",0
be incorrect_,0
calculated crude OR 's and CI s from,0
your published case Bnd control counts,0
for each,0
exposure category and was surprised t0,0
"find that the cude results for ""yes/no""",0
identically,0
replicated your published results_,0
This was,0
surprising because You indicaled on page,0
42,0
that '[uJnconditional logistic,0
regression was used to estimate the,0
effecf of exposure with,0
"adjustment for covariates, including",0
"agc, cducation;",0
type ofhospital.,0
Does Table 2,0
contain adjusted or crude results?  Your,0
paper does not clearly state if the,0
results in Table,0
"2 are, Or are not, adjusted,",0
My calculated crude results for,0
"smoker in the household""",0
"was 0.93 (95% CI: 0.42-2.06) and for ""2+",0
"smokers in the houschold"" was 0.87 (9S%",0
CI:,0
0.31-2.45)_,0
Thcse calculated crude sub-category,0
results are logically consistent with,0
the,0

Methods,0
to Estimate_Sustained_Dose,0
Before discussing,0
how,0
to control and,0
maximize,0
the,0
dose of,0
tobacco smoke,0
delivered,0
to,0
experimenta],0
animals,0
we,0
need,0
to take,0
stock,0
briefly 0f,0
the major,0
methods,0
currently,0
used,0
to measure,0
sus -,0
tained,0
dose and,0
to suggest possible,0
new approaches,0
It,0
is,0
important,0
to remember that,0
we Wi]],0
be,0
measur,0
tobacco smoke components,0
only,0
rather,0
than whole,0
tobacco,0
smoke,0
but hopefully,0
such,0
measure-,0
ments wil},0
be,0
indicative,0
of,0
class 0f compounds,0
or,0
a sie,0
gnificant,0
fraction of,0
tobacco,0
smoke,0
"Currently,",0
two main options,0
are,0
avaj]-,0
able for measuring,0
or,0
estimating,0
tobacco smoke dose,0
with,0
perhaps,0
third,0
one,0
to be added,0
in,0
the future_,0
The first,0
is,0
to measure,0
normally occurring tobacco,0
smoke,0
constituents,0
(or,0
their derivatives),0
in,0
the body,0
or body fluids,0
of exposed,0
anima ] s _,0
The,0
est and,0
most,0
common,0
example of,0
approach,0
is,0
determination,0
COHb _,0
The,0
second,0
principal,0
approach,0
developed,0
more recently,0
is,0
to  Tabel,0
tobacco with,0
chemical,0
or radioactive,0
tracers,0
then,0
determine,0
the,0
amount of,0
tracer,0
in the respiratory,0
tract of_,0
the exposed,0
animals,0
This,0
method,0
is much more compl icated,0
than,0
the former and requires,0
that,0
one have,0
some know,0
of,0
the fate,0
of,0
the,0
tracer,0
during,0
pyrolysis,0
its,0
distribution,0
in,0
the,0
tobacco,0
smoke,0
its volatility,0
etc.,0
Typical,0
amples,0
of,0
this,0
are studies,0
with,0
decachloro-,0
bipheny,0
(2),0
hexadecane (3),0
and,0
"(4,5)",0
The,0
advantage,0
of,0
this,0
method,0
is,0
that,0
one,0
can,0
measure dose,0
to,0
the,0
directly (though it,0
may be debatable,0
what fraction of tobacco smoke,0
the,0
measured quantity represents),0
The disadvantage,0
is,0
that (at,0
Ieast,0
with,0
the,0
markers,0
currently,0
in,0
use),0
destructive test js,0
re-,0
red,0
to determine,0
the,0
amount of,0
tracer,0
in,0
the lungs _,0
third,0
possible a}ternative is,0
to,0
use depletion of smoke components,0
from,0
the,0
exposure,0
chamber,0
as,0
measure,0
of uptake or_,0
dose to,0
the animals,0

"feasible, probably will apply only",0

SUMMARY,0
Time resolved measurements 0f,0
intrapuff nicotine del ivery,0
in,0
ma instream,0
smoke,0
have been performed with,0
specially designed intrapuff,0
smoking apparatus (IPSA) _,0
The IPSA-filter traversing mechanism,0
collects,0
ma instream particulates,0
on,0
rectangular,0
filter pad,0
which,0
moves,0
at,0
constant,0
velocity perpendicular to,0
the direction,0
of,0
smoke,0
flow at the mouth,0
"end of"" the",0
cigarette_,0
Filter pads,0
were assayed by,0
two analytical,0
techniques,0
Standard gas chromatographic (GC)_,0
methodology,0
was used,0
to,0
quantitate nicotine,0
concentration,0
in five equa],0
time,0
segments,0
per puff.-,0
second method,0
using,0
Berthold,0
TLC -,0
Linear,0
Analyzer,0
measured total,0
radioactivity across the pad,0
for,0
14C-nicotine,0
Iabe] led cigarettes_,0
Intrapuff nicotine concentrations,0
were determined from measured,0
puff,0
flow profiles,0
and the collected masses 0f nicotine,0
on,0
the,0
filters_,0
GC nicotine concentration,0
measurements,0
correlated,0
weh1,0
with total,0
activity,0
from the,0
scanner measurements,0
Studies carried out,0
with full,0
Flavor cigarettes,0
revealed,0
that,0
nicotine concentrations,0
in,0
the,0
smoke,0
vary,0
significantly during,0
puff,0
This work provides,0
new technique,0
for studying time-resolved,0
del ivery of,0
ma instream,0
smoke,0
components_,0
It,0
may,0
also be,0
used,0
to elucidate,0
mechani smS,0
contro]l,0
the del,0
of nicotine,0
and,0
other,0
mainstream smoke,0
components_,0
INTRODUCTION,0
It has become increasingly important to,0
better understand the,0
mechanisms by which,0
"smoke components,",0
(especially nicotine_,0
are,0
del ivered,0
to,0
mainstream smoke_,0
"To this end,",0
instrumentation was,0
developed to make,0
time -,0
reso]ved measurements,0
of mainstream,0
smoke components,0
dur-,0
individual,0
puffs,0
Central,0
to,0
the function,0
of IPSA is,0
means of,0
puff,0
flow-,0
rate profiles,0
accurately,0
The,0
method,0
for measuring,0
profi,0
was,0
a modification,0
of,0
that reported by Reynolds (1) _,0
The absence 0f these types,0
of measurements,0
in,0
the Iiterature,0
is,0
testimony,0
to evidence,0
for their difficulty.,0
For,0
example,0
Ceschini,0

INTRODUCTION,0
Fibrous glass has beon percetved by some,0
es potentially ol toxlcologlcal,0
slgniilcance_,0
Product prototypes of XDU,0
utilize & specia) form of fbrous glass,0
"In their manufacture, To essure that no",0
slgniticant amount of fibrous glass cen,0
bo transferred to the XDU mainstream,0
"smoke, scientists h the Toxicology",0
DivIsion and the Regulatory and,0
Scientific,0
Atfairs Division established a program,0
to measure mainstream fibrous,0
trenster;,0
The Implementatton of this,0
progrem by Mr:,1
"Avalos, Mr: Keith Shreve and Mr, Guy",1
Spence Is the basis tor thoir,1
conslderation as reciplents,0
of the 'China Breaker Award' =,0
The PAOGRAM,0
program to measure the fiber trenster In,0
malnstream XDU smoke requlres many,0
steps   The prIncipal steps,0
include:,0
1) Identifying,0
preparlng standards of fibrous glass to,0
be used In assessing tha etfilclency of,0
transfer In each,0
"phase o the smoke collection effort, 2)",0
Ientitying and Implementing an,0
appropriate smoke collectlon system,0
compatibla with the endpointa to be,0
meesured and 3) Identifylng and,0
utilizing @ quantitative technlque for,0
counting,0
the fibers that may be trensterred In,0
the smoke_,0
Each ot these princlpal steps Is,0
"comprleed ot many smaller, but",0
significant eflorts &s weli,0
At tho time of program Initiation; a,0
tlmeline was agreed upon that wes based,0
on management's bost sclentlic,0
understanding ot the problem and the,0
"need for & rapld response:  Jerry, Keith",1
and Guy understood that,1
woul,0
be Under significant pressure to meet,0
"tha goals of the program from day-one,",0
"and were, of course,",0
to glve,0
"their best etforts,",0
Everything wes outlined and work could,0
proceed &s plenned:,0
This is when the story becomes,0
interesting:,0
WHY A 'CHINA BREAKEA AWARD',0
Kelth and,0
knew from conversatln with managemont,0
that,0
earlier the program could be completed,0
the,0
better tor the Company In & numbar of,0
areas_,0
Aather than lust conduct the study &s,0
"outlined,",0
discussed tho,0
program among thamselves and identified,0
several akterative epproaches that just,0
"mlght be faster; loss expensive,",0
and less labor-intensive;,0
chose an alternative approach and went,0
to work to demonstrete its potential;,0
Rather than employing scanning electron,0
microscopy to vlsuelize end count,0
fibors that may be collected In the,0
"fiber transfor studies,",0
chose to use polarlzed Iight microscopy,0
with an Intertace to & vldeo tape,0
recorder and,0
televislon monltor,0
This approach was validated by the team,0
and proved to be very advantageous,0
The advantages Include:,0
1) The elimination ot sample preparatlon,0
"for scanning electron mlcroscopy, an",0
etfort that roquired about an hour,0
sample;,0
2) A reduction ot tlme tor sample,0
quantitation trom tour hours to 20,0
minutes per samplo;,0
3) The elimination ot a major dependoncy,0
on sophisticated Instrumentation (SEM},0
with a hlgh demand tor utilization,0
on many high prlorlty company programs;,0
Elimlnated subsequent projoct,0
interruptions for those other programs,0
wlthin the Company that depend on the,0
1,0
avallabllity ot scanning electron,0
microscopy;,0
5),0
A reduction in labor nocessary to,0
provide the data of interest;,0

demonstrate tha quantification process,0

Dear Df. Wu:,0
Thank you for your expression of,0
interest in our program of research,0
support,0
I am pleased to,0
enclose a recent Annual Report that,0
lists grants currently supported and,0
brochure describing,0
policies of,0
The Council,0
Our application procedure is a two-step,0
"process, comprising &",0
"preliminary inquiry and, if that is",0
"approved, & final proposal",0
To accomplish the first step;,0
potential applicants should submit a,0
brief (3 to,0
4 page) preliminary outline of the study,0
for,0
which support is sought,0
It should contain the following,0
information:,0
A synopsis of the project under,0
"investigation, its present goals and",0
status_,0
A brief outline of plans and goals for,0
"the proposed research, specifying the",0
next steps to be,0
taken:,0
Anticipated duration and annual direct,0
costs of the study as proposed:,0
Please note that The,0
Council will only provide support for,0
a maximum of,0
3 years.,0
Although grants are made for,0
one year at a time; Up to two annual,0
renewals can be considered 0n the basis,0
of progress,0
reports and materials submitted with,0
renewal applications,0
It would also be helpful to have;,0
Brief curricula vitae and scientific,0
bibliographies of the applicant and,0
principal professional,0
level collaborators,0
The two-page NIH format is preferred Eor,0
the preliminary inquiry,0
One copy each of any two or three,0
"publications, abstracts Or manuscripts",0
that are closely,0
related to the project for which funding,0
is being sought,0
Preliminary inquires are evaluated by,0
the Executive Committee of Our,0
Scientific Advisory,0
"Board for scientific merit and for ""fit""",0
into The Council's current,0
multidisciplinary biomedical,0
research program,0
The reviewers either encourage Or,0
discourage submission of,0
formal,0
detailed application for full,0
competitive consideration:,0
That process takes approximately two,0
months,0
"IE the vote is to encourage, then",0
appropriate forms and instructions are,0
provided;,0
Submission deadlines for full (not,0
preliminary_,0
applications are May 31 and November 30;,0
activation is typically seven months,0
later,0

Superslims is finally over in the US_,0
PM USA,0
has won;,0
"In particular, last fall PM USA was",0
successhil at the Federal Circuit in,0
arguing that the relevant claims of,0
"BeW""s US",0
"Reissue Patent 32,815 re a cigarette wl",0
"a reduced circumterence were invalid,",0
which upheld & '9g,0
to the same effect,0
by federal district court in Louisville,0
in a trial beginning in '89_,0
B&W attempted to have & rehearing at the,0
Federal Circuit,0
and was denied   The time has nOw passed,0
for BeW's last recourse_,0
a petition t0 the,0
Supreme Court; without any fling by,0
them_,0
"Re specliics, this clears the way tor",0
future PM USA production of Superslims,0
"for export, assuming no relevant BAT",0
patents,0
in the particular cauntries af,0
destination_,0
We are currently,0
researching the issue specifically in,0
Japan to see if there are,0
other BAT patents in addition to the BAT,0
Japanese patent successfully,0
invalidated by JT with PM assistance and,0
will,0
report the results when available in,0
~3-6 weekb_,0
Of course_,0
our,0
proposed global resolution to BAT in,0
response to their,0
olter t0 settle the issue in Australia,0
would resolve Ihls question on &,0

Special recognition needs to be made of,0

List Management,0
The fallowing outines the steps taken by,0
RJR to reduce; t the point 0f,0
elimination; the,0
likelihood that someone under 18 (the,0
legal age t0 smoke in virtually all,0
states) will,0
Teceive product or promotional items,0
from us through the mail,0
Minimum Age,0
It is important t0 remember that wa only,0
mail to smokers wto are 21,0
years Of age Or older,0
We & not mail t0 smokers of legal age,0
who are younger than,0
"21,ie;, Smokers Who are 18-20 years of",0
age.   We think this builds in a margin,0
of,0
safety_,0
In addition; we attempt to verify the,0
aga 0 21-24 year old smokers on our list,0
using,0
two independent third party sources_,0
We do this quarterly:  Tha third party,0
vendors,0
have established strict matching aiteria,0
wtich ensures the quality ot the,0
matches:,0
Wen a nama is matched by an autside,0
"source, the smokers record is flagged as",0
verifed;,0
Those names sant but not matched are,0
flagged as sentAny smokers,0
determined by te third party sources t,0
be lss han 21 yeers of age are,0
immediately,0
removed from our list,0
Those names confimed t ba over 21 and,0
those wto are not,0
found at all in the independent,0
databases are retained in our database.,0
Smoker Cenification,0
We believe that our mailing list,0
contains sm@kers wh1o are,0
21 years of age or older.,0
We mail these smokers coupons and ur ow,0
brand,0
preference screeners,0
However; we anly mail sample product and,0
promotional items,0
to,0
people who have signed a fom that,0
certifies:,0
are a smoker;,0
"They are 21 years Of age or okJer; &d,",0
They want to recelve offers from Us.,0
Our certification regimen is,0
most strict in the tobacco industry: We,0
Tequire &,0
smoker to actively insert his or her,0
birth date 0n te certliication fom,0
We teel this,0
added involvement is another way of,0
making the soker sensitve to what he &r,0
she,0
is doing,0
Further; our fon points out that giving,0
false infomation in Order t0 take,0
advantage of,0
an offer may constitute a crime (mail,0
fraud),0
We think that most pecple are honest;,0
but this reminder provides an additonal,0
safeguard.,0
"All screeners, comment cards, MGMs;",0
"Order forms, ad other communicaton that",0

standard smoker certfication,0

Our system is designed to alkw us t,0

for smoker certifcations   Typically; We,0

Doral Equity Test Issue8,0
Jackie and Gentlemen:,0
Listed below are the answers to the five,0
quastions that you proposed on our,0
recent conferance call,0
relative to the Doral equity lest,0
If an account is,0
to fund the $.50 differential betwean,0
Daral and its branded competitive,0
"set;, this i8 acceptable:",0
"However; I thie becomos widespread , it",0
would flaw the test but,0
don't think tha retailers wll,0
"reduce their margins by $.50,",0
2),0
The marqueelawning pragram can ba sold,0
and implemanted in higher volume,0
convenience gas,0
outlets and is not exclusive to,0
cigarette outlets; however; CO's would,0
be our first priority.,0
3),0
The $.50 per carton/s.05 par pack,0
applies t0 ell trade segments_,0
Tha bottom line is in the entire,0
retail universe within the Kansas,0
Divlsion should reflect Doral $.05 less,0
a pack/s.50 kess a,0
carton vs. branded competitive eets_,0
"Relative t the pricing survey issuas,",0
adjustrents will be made which will,0
reflect on strategy if,0
Doral is $.50 less & cartons.05 less a,0
pack vs. branded competitive sets_,0
5),0
The additional part-time labor request,0
(32 hours a week) is still undar,0
consideration,0
Will adviea,0
when declsion has been made_,0

a8,0

propose that,0

If,0

Is it a genuine PM praducts?,0
"If yes, which region was it suppose to",0

wa S,0
much redundancy;,0
have tried to select descriptive,0

"In brief,",0

The analytical precision curve for the,0
[WO-stage,0
amalgamation system was further studied,0
with &,0
concertration range from 0.l ng Up to 10,0
ng of Hg:,0
"As expected, the precision at the low",0
concentration,0
was not aS good as at the high,0
"concentration, 5.9 % RSD for 0.1 ng Hg",0
verse 0.3 % RSD for 10 ng Hg:,0
The individual trap efficiency of 41,0
Au-Pt traps was Studied by the,0
purge-and-trap of S ng of Hg standard,0
Thc maximum difference was found bcing,0
less than,0
% that indicatcs the precigc get-up for,0
thc two stagc,0
gold amalgamation system:,0
The trap efficiency of Au-Pt gauze wes,0
studied by connecting two Au-Pt traps in,0
serial and the mercury,0
amoitnt was analyzed independently _,0
"The amount of mercury breakthrough,",0
based on the second Au-Pt,0
"Irap, was found to be",0
I% for 5 ng of Hg and 1.596 for IQ pg of,0
Hg:,0
"The instnmen LOD, 0.011 ng, was",0
determincd based on ]0 replicates of,0
purge and trap of reagent blanks_,0
"The method LOD,0.1 ng",0
was also determined based on 10,0
replicates of Smoking blanks,0
3 ng of Fg was spiked onto tie Au trap,0
before smloking lhe JR#F cigarette for,0
mcthod accuracy study_,0
"Only 60% recovery of Hg was recovered,",0
which can not justify the performance of,0
trap_,0
Two Icasons,0
"For this pOOr recovery, one is that the",0
amount of Au was not enough to trap both,0
mercury and volatile,0
organic vapor passing through,0
electrostatic precipitation; &nd the,0
olher is the deactivation of,0
Au trap,0
caused by sorne Organic vapor_,0
To solve Whis problem; 2 catalysl,0
converter is going to be placed before,0
gold trap to decompose organic vapor,0
