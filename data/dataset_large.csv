BACKGROLNMETHODOLOGY,0
The primary objective of this reseaich,0
was to further kearn about Generation,0

Factors that unite andlor influence,0
their generation,0
Similarities and differences between,0
theit generation and their parent's,0
generation,0
Segments ito which their generation can,0
be divided ad how those segments,0
can be iddentified,0
Towards the end of the,0
"groups,respondents were shown & number",0
ofprint ads,0
and were asked to sort them into piles_,0
depicting different segnents of the,0
population: They were then questioned,0
about why the ads were for these,0
"specific groups, with a special focus On",0
ads that,0
felt were,0
them,0
SUMMARY QFFINDNGS,0
Tese young adults view their generation,0
"as diverse,having varied interests and",0

friends who are interested a variety of,0
things and lead lives that are not the,0
same as their own:,0
Despite the diversity found among these,0
"young adults, Generation Xers do",0
appear to share certain attitudinal and,0
behavioral characteristics. Specifically,0
",",0
these shared characteristics are that,0
they:,0
Resist segmentation and labeling,0
Are self-focused,0
Have mistust for the news mdia,0
Show,0
marketing savvy,0
Like to try new things and experience,0
life,0
Believe financial securty is important,0
but is not their ultimate,0

The analytical precision curve for the,0
[WO-stage,0
amalgamation system was further studied,0
with &,0
concertration range from 0.l ng Up to 10,0
ng of Hg:,0
"As expected, the precision at the low",0
concentration,0
was not aS good as at the high,0
"concentration, 5.9 % RSD for 0.1 ng Hg",0
verse 0.3 % RSD for 10 ng Hg:,0
The individual trap efficiency of [1,0
Au-Pt traps was Studied by the,0
purge-and-trap of S ng of Hg standard,0
Thc maximum difference was found bcing,0
less than,0
% that indicatcs the precigc get-up for,0
thc two stagc,0
gold amalgamation system:,0
The trap efficiency of Au-Pt gauze wes,0
studied by connecting two Au-Pt traps in,0
serial and the mercury,0
amoitnt was analyzed independently _,0
"The amount of mercury breakthrough,",0
based on the second Au-Pt,0
"Irap, was found to be",0
I% for 5 ng of Hg and 1.596 for IQ pg of,0
Hg:,0
"The instnmen LOD, 0.01L ng, was",0
determincd based on 10 replicates of,0
purge and trap of reagent blanks_,0
"The method LOD,0.1 ng",0
was also determined based on 10,0
replicates of Smoking blanks,0
3 ng of Fg was spiked onto tie Au trap,0
before smloking lhe JR#F cigarette for,0
mcthod accuracy study_,0
Only 60% recovery of Hg was recovered;,0
which can not justify the performance of,0
trap_,0
Two Icasons,0
"For this pOOr recovery, One is that the",0
amount of Au was not enough to trap both,0
mercury and volatile,0
organic vapor passing through,0
electrostatic precipitation; &nd the,0
olher is the deactivation of,0
Au trap,0
caused by sorne Organic vapor_,0
To solve Whis problem; 2 catalysl,0

Dear Dr. Chisholm,0
Thank You for your expression of,0
interest in our program of research,0
support,0
I am pleased to,0
enclose & recent Annual Report that,0
lists grants currently supported and &,0
brochure describing,0
policies of The Council,0
Our application procedure is & two-step,0
"process, comprising &",0
"prelininary inquiry and, if that is",0
"approved, & Final proposal",0
"To accomplish the first step,",0
potential applicants should submit a,0
brief preliminary outline (3 to,0
4 pages total) of the study,0
Far which support is sought,0
It should contain the following,0
information:,0
A synopsis of the project under,0
"investigation, its present goals and",0
status,0
A brief outline of plans &nd goals for,0
"the proposed research, specifying the",0
next steps to be,0
taken-,0
Anticipated duration and annual direct,0
costs Of the study as propased Please,0
note that The,0
Council will only provide support for &,0
maximum of 3 years Aithough grants are,0
made for,0
"one year at a time ""p to two annual",0
renewals can be considered O1 the basis,0
oE progress,0
reports and materials submitted with,0
renewal applications,0
It would also be helpful to have:,0
Brief curricula vitae and scientific,0
bibliographies of the applicant and,0
principal professional,0
level collaborators,0
The two-page NIH format is preferred for,0
the preliminary inquiry_,0
One copy each of any two Or three,0
"publications, abstracts or manuscripts",0
that are closely,0
related to the project for which funding,0
is,0
sought,0
Preliminary inquires are evaluated by,0
the Executive Committee of our,0

Dear Mr: Oldaker;,0
Iread your rccent letter to Dave Tott,0
telling of your past association with,0
Art Yorozu:,0
You also described your analytical model,0
predicting levels,0
"of contaminates in B727 aircraft cabins,",0
and requested detailed,0
"information on the B727 ventilation, air",0
velocities and leakage rates,0
We appreciate your need to improve the,0
accuracy 0f your analytical model,0
by obtaining the described detailed,0
"information Unfortunately, the",0
limited amount of information that we,0
may be able to provide you would,0
be of little use.,0
"All information on air velocities,",0
ventilation rates and,0
leakage rates for the B727 is for new,0
production aircralt; These values,0
could change significanlly as a Iunclion,0
0f interior configuration; aircraft,0
service life and maintenance history.,0
Thc test data You mentioned;,0
obtained from measurements within,0
"aircraft cabins, is most likely your",0
best source of information today:,0
Im sOrry Wc cannot mect your needs,0
Please feel free to contact me at,0
(206) 234-9973 if we can be of further,3
service.,0

Dear Mr: Oldaker;,0
Iread your rccent letter to Dave Tott,0
telling of your past association with,0
Art Yorozu:,0
You also described your analytical model,0
predicting levels,0
"of contaminates in B727 aircraft cabins,",0
and requested detailed,0
"information on the B727 ventilation, air",0
velocities and leakage rates,0
We appreciate your need to improve the,0
accuracy 0f your analytical model,0
by obtaining the described detailed,0
"information Unfortunately, the",0
limited amount of information that we,0
may be able to provide you would,0
be of little use.,0
"All information on air velocities,",0
ventilation rates and,0
leakage rates for the B727 is for new,0
production aircralt; These values,0
could change significanlly as a Iunclion,0
0f interior configuration; aircraft,0
service life and maintenance history.,0
Thc test data You mentioned;,0
obtained from measurements within,0
"aircraft cabins, is most likely your",0
best source of information today:,0
Im sOrry Wc cannot mect your needs,0
Please feel free to contact me at,0
(206) 234-9973 if we can be of further,3
service.,0

panel ot indcpendent scientists chasen,0
by You,0
Yaur request is without precedent in the,0
scientifc community: The snudy uoder,0

indings bave bccn validated by,0
distinguished pathologists of woridwide,0
"teputation In addition,",0
"othcr Ieading pathologists, highly",0
"regarded by the scicatific community,",0
have visited Dr. Auerbach'$,0
laboratory; scen his slides and praised,0
the work:,0
We do not intend to ask that these {wo,0
cminent men submit thcir findings to any,0
selected,0
committee chosen by the Tobacco,0
"Institule, or any other goup. Tkeir work",0
will bc judged in the,0
"taditional manner ot American science,",0
where,0
"@ndings are presented, discussed ,",0
accepted Or rejecred,0
by sieatists &nd physicians whose only,0
motivation is the truth; Doctors,0
Auerbach and Hammond,0
worked freely and withaut restraint with,0
funds fumished by thc federal government,0

Dear Dr. Hockett:,0
Thank You very,0
much for the privilege of reading thi,0
manuscript _,0
return,0
it to you herewith and also enclose,0
Copy %f,0
recent article that has,0
scie interest,0
and apparently contradictery,0
findings,0
namely that the VST,0
"returns to norma""",0
within,0
0 short time after experimental,0
igation of & coronary,0
artery,0
am sti1},0
very much disturbed witk,0
the clinica/ implication of,0
"this manuscript ,",0
As,0
"wrote previously,",0
the audience and the reader i$ con-,0
ditioned to accept the results,0
without recognizing that the experiments,0
possibly lack &]inical,0
relevance.,0
Thus,0
(1) The authors Point out that,0
the Framingham study found that sudden,0
death fro coronary artery,0
disease was four tines as high,0
in the heavy saker as,0
is the,0
non-smoker_,0
Fhe authors als0 point out that the most,0
Tikely cause for,0
sudden death,0
is ventricular,0
fibrillation_,0
What,0
au;hors,0
fafl to state,0
is that neither the Framingham group,0
nor any other group found,0
that sudden death from coronary artery,0
disease,0
occurs,0
predominantly whfle' smoking,0
or sooner after smoking,0
If this Were,0
S0,0
there wuld,0
be Iittle difficulty,0
in proving,0
cause and effect,0
On the contrary,0
the tempora],0
relation between smok,0
and sudden death has never been,0
documented,0
Indeed,0
271,0
eviderce,0
at,0
Jeast within the hospi ta7,0
"and within the Coronary Care Unit,",0
Indi -,0
cates that ventricular fibrillation with,0
or without,0
sudden death occurs without,0
imdiate antecedent smking,0
The experimenta,0
"tempora""",0
relation therefore has,0
cotnter part in clinica,0
medicine_,0
do belfeve that these points,0
should be,0
discussed and stressed in this article.,0

SUMMARY,0
Time resolved measurements 0f,0
intrapuff nicotine del ivery,0
in,0
ma instream,0
smoke,0
have been performed with,0
specia]ly designed intrapuff,0
smoking apparatus (IPSA) _,0
The IPSA-filter traversing mechanism,0
collects,0
ma instream particulates,0
on,0
rectangular,0
filter pad,0
which,0
moves,0
at,0
constant,0
velocity perpendicular to,0
the direction,0
of,0
smoke,0
flow at the mouth,0
"end of"" the",0
cigarette_,0
Filter pads,0
were assayed by,0
two analytical,0
techniques,0
Standard gas chromatographic (GC)_,0
methodology,0
was used,0
to,0
quantitate nicotine,0
concentration,0
in five equa],0
time,0
segments,0
per puff.-,0
second method,0
using,0
Berthold,0
TLC -,0
Linear,0
Analyzer,0
measured total,0
radioactivity across the pad,0
for,0
14C-nicotine,0
Iabe] led cigarettes_,0
Intrapuff nicotine concentrations,0
were determined from measured,0
puff,0
flow profiles,0
and the collected: masses 0f nicotine,0
on,0
the,0
filters_,0
GC nicotine concentration,0
measurements,0
correlated,0
web1,0
with total,0
activity,0
from the,0
scanner measurements,0
Studies carried out,0
with full,0
Flavor cigarettes,0
revealed,0
that,0
nicotine concentrations,0
in,0
the,0
smoke,0
vary,0
significantly during,0
puff,0
This work provides,0
new technique,0
for studying time-resolved,0
del ivery of,0
ma instream,0
smoke,0
components_,0
It,0
may,0
also be,0
used,0
to elucidate,0
mechani smS,0
contro]l,0
the del,0
of nicotine,0
and,0
other,0
mainstream smoke,0
components_,0
INTRODUCTION,0
It has become increasingly important to,0
better understand the,0
mechanisms by which,0
"smoke components,",0
(especially nicotine_,0
are,0
del ivered,0
to,0
mainstream smoke_,0
"To this end,",0
instrumentation was,0
developed to make,0
time -,0
reso]ved measurements,0
0f mainstream,0
smoke components,0
dur-,0
individual,0
puffs,0
Central,0
to,0
the function,0
of IPSA is,0
means of,0
puff,0
flow-,0
rate profiles,0
accurately,0
The,0
method,0
for measuring,0
profi,0
was,0
a modification,0
of,0
that reported by Reynolds (1) _,0
The absence 0f these types,0
of measurements,0
in,0
the Iiterature,0
is,0
testimony,0
to evidence,0
for their difficulty.,0
For,0
example,0
Ceschini,0
(3),0

Introduction,0
The,0
c-fos gene belongs to the family,0
of growth-,0
and  differentiation-related,0
"immediate early genes whose expression,",0
"in vivo and in vitro, represents the",0
first,0
measurable response to,0
a variety of chemical and physical,0
stimuli including,0
tumor promoters and DNA-damaging agents.,0
The expression of c-fos has been,0
identified as a signal for cell,0
proliferation; but also for apoptosis:,0
Findings:,0
2R1 mainstream smoke-bubbled,0
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) induces,0
~fos expression in quiescent 3T3,0
fibroblast cells,0
concentralion-dependently,0
threshold,0
concentration,0

by,0
interfering,0

transcriptional,0
and,0
posttranscriptional,0
regulatory,0
components,0
since,0
a slight  induction,0
Of the,0
c-fos promoter and,0
strong,0
stabilization of c-fos transcripts were,0
observed.,0
The translation of smoke-,0
bubbled PBS-induced c-fos mRNA into,0
protein was confirmed,0
immuno-,0
detection methods,0
independently of the presence of,0
hydroxyl radicals formed by the Fenton,0
reaction since neither 0-phenanthroline,0
"an efficient,  membrane permeable",0
scavenger of iron cations,0
nor catalase were able to reduce,0
cigarette smoke-,0
dependent c-fos expression at,0
concentrations that were shown t0,0
inhibit DNA,0
strand break formation:,0
the kinetics being different  from,0
those reported for physiological,0
inducers,0
"(growth factors ,",0
serum); TPA_,0
"or stress treatment (heat shock, UV,",0
hydroxyl,0
radicals),0
in a manner very similar to that,0
"described for okadaic acid,",0
specific inhibitor,0
of cell cycle-specific phosphatases,0
and 2A,0
(PP-II2A),0
Cellular   effects,0
shared by smoke-bubbled PBS ad okadaic,0
acid in vitro are:,0
"kinetics of c-tos expression,",0
pattern,0
"ofc-fos  expression,",0
"ie, the slight  activation",0
of the,0
c-fos,0
promoter s well as the stabilization 0f,0
"c-fos mRNA,",0
"partial inhibition of protein synthesie,",0
induction of stress response genes such,0
as heme oxygenase_,0
"induction of cell cycle arrest, and",0
inhibition of PP_1/2A enzymatic,0
activities_,0

Dear Dr; Kabal:,0
recently reviewed your paper; 'Relation,0
between exposure to environmental,0
tobacco,0
smoke and,0
"cancer in lifetime nonsmokers"" (Kabat",0
"GC, Stellman SD, Wynder EL.",0
Am,0
"Epldemiol 142(2}.141-8, 1995), and noted",0
a logical inconsistency that likely,0
"indicates & minor ertor,",0
"Specifically, in Table 2 (page [44), you",0
list the odds ratios for males for,0
exposure in,0
"childhood as 0.90 for ""yes"" (i.e-, any",0
"exposure), 1.12 for",0
smoker in the household;,0
"and 1.13 for ""2+ smokers in the",0
household_,0
These two later catcgories merely,0
partition,0
"the ""yes"" category, therefore te OR for",0
"""yes"" should be sme weig",0
average of the,0
OR's for the,0
sub-categories and should fall between,0
"1,12 &nd 1.13",0
"This js,",0
"unfortunately, not true in the published",0
"table, thus one or more of the OR must,",0
"believe,",0
be incorrect_,0
calculated crude OR 's and CI s from,0
your published case Bnd control counts,0
for each,0
exposure category and was surprised t0,0
"find that the cude results for ""yes/no""",0
identically,0
replicated your published results_,0
This was,0
surprising because You indicaled on page,0
42,0
that '[uJnconditional logistic,0
regression was used to estimate the,0
effecf of exposure with,0
"adjustment for covariates, including",0
"agc, cducation;",0
type ofhospital.,0
Does Table 2,0
contain adjusted or crude results? Your,0
paper does not clearly state if the,0
results in Table,0
"2 are, Or are not, adjusted,",0
My calculated crude results for,0
"smoker in the household""",0
"was 0.93 (95% CI: 0.42-2.06) and for ""2+",0
"smokers in the houschold"" was 0.87 (9S%",0
CI:,0
0.31-2.45)_,0
Thcse calculated crude sub-category,0
results are logically consistent with,0
the,0
"published, dichotomous ""yes/no* results",0

Setting,0
little fires is very common and seems to,0
be considered a rite 0f passage; a,0

My preliminary thought is that our,0
challenge will be to craft messages,0
that,0
challenge the de facto acceptance of,0
this type of arson by showing people,0
that this,0
behavior has serious consequences and,0
should not be accepted,0
I also think a smoke detector,0
component is,0
appropriate,0
We ais0 tested materials,0

is explained,0
below.,0
S46m was spent with,0
TRACKER in,0

for diary,0
panel,0
recruitment _,0
On,0
a cost/complete,0
basis,0
this,0
cost,0
was,0
more than,0
what,0
we,0
d,0
MARC,0
for,0
smoker recrui-,0
through,0
SRMS _,0
When questioned,0
about,0
this,0
discrepancy,0
MARC,0
attributed this,0
cost,0
di,0
fference to,0
the,0
different markups,0
each group in MARC,0
used _,0
MARC,0
has,0
standardized,0
this markup,0
and,0
the,0
pr,0
was reduced,0
to $23m.,0
Instead,0
of,0
reducing the cost of,0
Tracker,0
"by S23m,",0
we,0
asked,0
TRACKER,0
to,0
use,0
this money to recruit,0
as many,0
smokers,0
as possible due,0
to,0
the,0
cost/complete with,0
the,0
new price,0
This has,0
resulted,0
in,0
doub],0
the number of smokers recruited .,0
We also made,0
procedura/ change in,0
how these,0
smokers,0
are used_,0
Instead of,0
these,0
smokers,0
directly,0
into,0
the diary pane],0
the,0
smokers will,0
now be placed,0
in the SRMS,0
and a)ocated,0
where,0
they,0
can provide the greatest,0
benefit_,0
For,0
"example,",0
an 18-24 year,0
old Marlboro,0
smoker,0
to,0
a CAMEL product test_,0
This will allow US,0
to maximize,0
savings,0

Ask First,0
lt's_the_Law (5/30,0
7/28),0
Selling cigarettes to minors is against,0
the law; Its that simple While PM USA,0
dces not sell cigarettes,0
"directly to consumers, PM USA has always",0
advocated that retail accounts comply,0
with the law:,0
One of the ways to further support the,0
Company's commitment regarding,0
restricting the sale of,0
cigarettes to minors is to reintorce,0
this principle with our accounts and,0
their employees:,0
"Importantly ,",0
retailers nationwide have been asking us,0
for assistance in complying with their,0
state laws,0
As,0
a result; we are,0
providing you with enhanced program,0
materials to use with your accounts,0
These program materials were,0
successfully tested in Cincinnati in the,0
fourth quarter of,0
1994_,0
Our,0
focus with accounts begins in June and,0
"July, with continuous program support in",0
the balance of,0
1995_,0
Program details are outlined below.,0
Current _,0
Situation,0
The Iaw holds retailers responsible for,0
selling tobacco products legally.,0
Retailers that sell cigarettes,0
"to minors may be subject to fines, a",0
loss of their licenses and possibly even,0
jail time.,0
Key _Issue,0
How do we help to inform and educate,0
retailers and their employees regarding,0
their responsibilities,0
to enforce their state laws?,0
Ihe,0
Plan,0
"In June and July, place the",0
"Ask Firstllt's the Law"" program in all",0
workload accounts,0
normal,0
call coverage_,0
Then continue to place materials during,0
"1995, making this part of your in-store",0
mission_,0
Here's How _,0
ItWorks,0
Selling Guidelines,0
Sell the program to all accounts &s,0
"a value-added service, beginning May 30",0
1995,0
Thoroughly,0
review,0
the,0
program,0
materials,0
to,0
ensure,0
that,0

It would be a,0

Critique,0
This propOsal appears L0 be a fine,0
tuning Of what is already known about,0
the opening,0
of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor,0
channels resulting in non specific,0
cation flow and,0
depolarization of cells_,0
Calcium influx is obligatory for thc,0
exocylotic fusion of,0
catecholamine-containing granules with,0
the plasma memhrane,0
The PI has found that,0
opening nicotinic catecholamine reactors,0
by,0
application of nicotine triggers,0
exocytosis,0
which is regulated by calcium,0
contribuled from intraccllutlar storcs_,0
Thcrc are,0
3 such pools-,0
an IP3 sensitive sture,0
4 caffeine sensitive Store and an,0
IP3-and catfeine-sensitivc storc,0
Shc,0
nOliced that the exocytotic response to,0
standard depolarizing voltage pulses,0
that open calcium,0
channels was potentiated after the cell,0
had been exposcc t0 nicatine_,0
This potentiation,0
not require extracellular calcium_,0
"persists for 10 minutes and again, she",0
believes that the,0
mechanism may inclucle activalion 0f,0
specific intracellular stores_,0
Similar potenliation of,0
dcpolarization-induccd sccrction was,0
ohserved when cells were exposed to,0
thapsigargin which,0
elevates calcium in bovinc chromaffin,0
"cclls,",0
Thc T'T is prolicient in paich,0
lamping and with,0
"her associate, Dr",1
Forinina_,1
has studied the effect of nivotine,0
0M1,0
depolarized evoked secretion,0
and she postulates that the mechanism,0
may involve specific irraccllular,0
calcium stores_,0
She,0
will usc: a perloralcd patch mnde to,0

dialysis which,0
allows enough time for the slow,0

The strategy is to deplete or block the,0
various intracellular,0

She will also,0
determine which second messenger systems,0

Card collecting; or cartophily as,0
experts call it; has been & favorite,0
pastime for collectors,0
back to the Igt century. It is,0
revived and updated for the 21* century,0
by,0
Doral through their Collector Cards,0
serieg AS & way ofbuilding on the,0

their money,0
The collector cards combine the,0
nostalgia of days gone by with,0
modern-day design;,0
giving collectors a,0
highly collectible card series The front,0
of each card features photos of,0
a landmark or historically preserved,0
scene,0
"the state represented, while the back of",0
the card gives a description of what's,0
pictured and several,0
"about the state, The cerds",0

during the,0
century,0
their popularity circa 1940,0

Listed below are the answers to the five,0
quastions that you proposed on our,0
recent conferance call,0
relative t0 the Doral equity lest,0
If an account is,0
to fund the $.50 differential betwean,0
Daral and its branded competitive,0
"set;, this i8 acceptable:",0
"However; I thie becomos widespread , it",0
would flaw the test but,0
don't think tha retailers wll,0
"reduce their margins by $.50,",0
2),0
The marqueelawning pragram can ba sold,0
and implemanted in higher volume,0
convenience gas,0
outlets and is not exclusive to,0
cigarette outlets; however; CO's would,0
be our first priority.,0
3),0
The $.50 per carton/s.05 par pack,0
applies t0 ell trade segments_,0
Tha bottom line is in the entire,0
retail universe within the Kansas,0
Divlsion should reflect Doral $.05 less,0
a pack/s.50 kess a,0
carton vs. branded competitive eets_,0
"Relative t the pricing survey issuas,",0
adjustrents will be made which will,0
reflect on strategy if,0
Doral is $.50 less & cartons.05 less a,0
pack vs. branded competitive sets_,0
5),0
The additional part-time labor request,0
(32 hours a week) is still undar,0
consideration,0

Dear Dr;,1

understand that the National Toxicology,0
Program is,0
accepting,0
comments for use in its,0
consideration of,0
petition t0 list environmental tobacco,0
"smoke (ETS"") as",0
'kmown human,0
carcinogen,0

huan carcinogen.,0
Scientists &t,0
R,0
Reynolds are gathering pertinent,0
intomation that we believe will assist,0

in its,0
detemination,0
That information will be forwarded to,0
you shortly by tbem:,0
In,0

a5   YOIl,0
"may know,",0
a | federal   district  court  recently,0
vacated,0
the 1992,0

that sought to,0
classify ETS a a known human carcinogen,0
1 epclose,0
a copy of the court '$ opinion for your,0
review,0
consideration 2s the NTP considers,0
listing ETS.,0
The opinion begins by discussing the,0
procedures Congress had established for,0
EPA to follow in,0
its research program on indoor air,0
quality:,0
The court concluded thet EPA fell short,0
of complying,0
with those procedures.,0
The coun,0
however; reviewed the record to,0
"detcrmine whether,",0
"""aside Gom procedural defects",0
(page 38) / EPA conducted,0
risk assessment in accordance,0
"with the Radon Research: Act,",0
The core scientific requirements of the,0
Radon Research Act are,0
identified as,0
"'[glathering all relevant infomation,",0
"researching, and disseminating findings""",0
"(page 90) and providing ""clear,",0
objective irformation about indoor air,0
"quality"" (page 91):",0
The,0
court found that EPA '$ goal was to name,0
"ETS a Group A carcinogen, rather than to",0
conduct an,0
objective scientific review:,0

Dear Joachim:,5
Iam,0
writing to confirm OUI willingness to,0
provide YOu with genomic DNA flanking,0
the S'-end,0
of,0
the,0
"rabbit surfactant protein-A , (SP-A)",0
gene for YOUf proposed,0
studies,0
to,0
target Cre,0
recombinase to pulmonary epithelial `,0
cells_,0
As you kow,0
the SP-A gene is expressed in,0
~specific manner; SP-A mRNA transcripts,0
are detected primarily in iype I,0
pneumonocytes,0
and to,0
lesser extent in nonciliated,0
bronchioalveolar epithelial (Clara),0
cells.,0
We have found,0
in studies,0
"transgenic mice that 4,000 bp of DNA",0
flanking the 5'-end of the rabbit SP-A,0
gene targets reporter gene expression,0
"only in lung, and specifically to type",0
"II and Clara cells,",0
In consideration of the cell-specific,0
"nature of SP-A promoter activity, this",0
genomic construct,0
should be most useful in targeting Cre,0
recombinase to the same cell iypes in,0
the lung that also,0
express,0
I Iead your grant prcposal with great,0
interest ad believe that YOuI studies,0
loxPiCre,0
recombinanse-mediated gene targeting fof,0
creating cell-specific inactivation of,0
will yield,0
important information Tegarding the role,0
of this protein in,0
cell,0

For,0
Molecular characterization of the signal,0
for radiation-inducible genes and the,0
isolation of,0
novel radiation-inducible genes in the,0
yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae:,0
"Michael Fasullo, Ph D. Loyola University",1
Specific Aims:,0
Damage-inducible (DIN) genes have been,0
cloned and characterized,0
many,0
"organisims, including yeast, bacteria,",0
and man:,0
of these genes are induced by & variety,0
of DNA damaging agents that inflict a,0
"diverse spectrum of DNA lesions,",0
including base paif,0
"damage, crOss-links, bulky adducts, and",0
single- and double-strand,0
breaks. These,0
DNA,0
damaging agents include chemicals that,0
cause oxidative damage via the formation,0
of free,0
"radicals, similar to those found in",0
tobacco smoke: The diversity of DNA,0
lesions causcd by,0
free radicals provokes the question of,0
whether all these lesions can Serve as,0
the primary,0
signal for damage-induction Or whether,0
these lesions are processed to a common,0
signal that,0
triggers the induction of DIN,0
gencs:,0
The aim of this project is to focus,0
specifically at,0
ionizing radiation as an agent that,0
induces DIN genes in yeast; to elucidate,0
the genetic,0
pathway by which,0
single double-strand break may serve a5,0
signal for the induction of,0
such genes; and to isolate novel,0
radiation-inducible genes that may be,0
triggered directly by,0
the presence of DNA double-strand breaks,0
The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has,0
been,0
chosen for these experiments becuase,0
many genes involved in the repair of,0
radiation damage,0
are,0
well defined and the molecular biolgy,0
and genetics to address the phenotypes,0
of,0
mutated genes is well advanced. In,0
additio roughly 1% of the yeast genome,0
is speculated,0
to,0
encode damage-inducible genes (Ruby and,0
"Szostak, 1985), only .a few yeast genes",0
have,0
been characterized as,0
damage-inducible; and previous attempts,0
to isolate DIN genes have,0
not utilized ionizing radiation as the,0
DNA damaging agent:,0
Siguificance:,0
Human genes that are induced by ionizing,0
radiation include TNFG: pS3,0
protein,0
kinasc,0
"IL-1, collagenase and",0
(growth arrest &nd DNA damage) These and,0
other,0
characterized genes represent a subset,0
of a theoretically much larger set of,0
genes (for review,0
"see Fornace, 1992).",0
Although the functional significance of,0
thc DIN genes has yet to be,0
explained;,0
recent evidence,0
has found that failure,0
to induce,0
is  correlated with,0
radiosensitivity in patients afflicted,0
"with Ataxia telangiectasia, and such",0
patients have,0
higher incidence of cancer; especially,0
lymphomas. The induction of these genes,0
by ionizing,0
radiation and free radicals may,0
occur  by,0
variety of signal transducing,0
mechanisms,0
Oxidative damage to membranes may,0
trigger the expression of protein,0
kinase,0
which,0
"phophorylates transcription factors,",0
"such aS jun, that in turn induce the",0
expression of such,0
genes,0
(Hallahan et al,0
"1991), although this may not be the",0
mechanism of the induction of,0
"5 . Alternatively, DNA damage may be the",0
primary signal for the induction of,0
damage-,0
inducible genes:,0
This,0
suggested by the observation that cell,0
lines that are defective in,0
damage,0
have higher levels of the expression Of,0
particular damage-inducible genes,0
"(Herrlich et al, 1992). onetheless, the",0
signal transduction mechanism which is,0
provoked,0
by,0
a DNA lesion is poorly understood:,0
Elucidation of the pathway by which,0
radiation-induced DNA lesions directly,0
stimulate,0
DIN genes may be better addressed in,0
yeast,0

REYNOLDS TOBACCO CALLS FOR COMMON SENSE,0
REGARDING ADVERTISING ISSUES,0
The debate over cigarette adverlising in,0
megazines eeds a big dose ofcommon sense,0
Critics of our advertising don't want,0
children to see cigarette ads in,0
magazines published,0
for and read by adults_,0
"However, the only way to guarantee that",0
no child ever saw a,0
cigarette ad would be to completely,0
cigarette advertising:,0
The real issuc is whether cigarettes,0
should be treated as legal products for,0
adults;,0
whether manufacturers have the right to,0
communicate with adult smokerg.,0
Cigarettes are already the most,0
restricted consumer product in terms of,0
marketing &nd,0
"advertising, but we have the legal right",0
to advertise in adult smokers in,0
publications that,0
are not youth-oriented.,0
Does,0
cigarette ad cause children,0
or adults ~ to,0
begin smoking? Common,0
sense tells you no. Govcrnment and,0
university studies show that peer,0
pressure and,0
family influence are the primary factors,0
in smoking initiation. And common Bense,0
tells,0
you that the vast majority of tobacco,0
messages that youth are exposed t0 today,0
are anti-,0
smoking messages_,0
So what would further restricting,0
cigarette advertising,0
or banning it - accomplish?,0
It,0
would be one more step in attemnpting to,0
make smoking more socially unacceptable,0
and,0
once,0
"again, treating",0
"legal product as ifit Were illegal,",0
would deprive cigarette,0
"manufacturers of a constitutional right,",0
but it would not resolve the youth,0
smoking issue.,0
Our standard is to advertise only in,0
publications in which at least,0
two-thirds of the,0
readership is age 18 or older: Further;,0
We evaluate the editorial content of the,0
publications over time to be sure the,0
topics covered are of interest to,0
predominantly adult,0
audiences We review the other,0
advertisers who appear in those,0
publications to ensure,0
that most are for products which,0
primarily are purchased by adults:,0
We also review,0
factors such as the publications',0
circulation dynamics &nd method of,0
distribution.,0
The same magazines we advertise in carry,0
ads for other adult products,0
such as alcohol_,0
"household appliances, and furniture In",0
"1998,the major tobacco companies signed",0
an,0
agreement with the States' attorneys,0
general that enacted sweeping bans and,0
restrictions,0
on cigarette,0
marketing This agreement does not,0
prohibit US from communicating with,0
adults who choose to smoke.,0

"FFLT;, I have reviewed various sources",0
ofinformation to determine the potential,0
source of,0
this leafbased on the pesticide residues,0
detected in product samples labeled 52],0
"and 615,",0
Unfortunalely_,0
no conclusions can be made in this,0
regard.,0
While residues of endosulfan and maleic,0
"hydrazide were detected, these two",0
pesticides are,0
used/registered for use in sevcral,0
"countrics,",0
the residues are well below any of the,0
limits,0
that have bccn established in tbese,0
countries Furthermore; these two,0
pesticides can be,0
to more than one type ofleaf Though,0
there are differences in pesticide,0
formulations,0
which maylmay not account for residue,0
"content; the duration in the field,",0
"weather conditions,",0
"etc_, can impact the degradation of",0
these pesticides.,0
"Lastly, the effects of blending can",0
dilute,0
the residue content in the final product,0

CAPITAL (France),0
As you']l remember from my previous,0
"memo, Eric Wattez, a",1
reporter with the French business,0
monthly Capital is writing a,0
cover,0
on Philip Morris Companies Inc:,0
He would like to,0
interview you sometime between September,0
915 or after,0
"September_20,",0
Background:,0
Capital is the leading French economic /,0
business magazine. It is,0
published by the Prisma Group and has,0
ties with the German,0
"group, Gruener & Jahr, which",0
publishes the German edition of,0
Capital,0
The French Capital was introduced in,0
October 1991 and met with,0
immediate success;,0
It surpassed the then-leading French,0
economic,0
"monthly, LExpansion: Today, Capital's",0
circulation has reached,0
"almost 300,000.",0
Capital employs somewhat unusual angles:,0
it tries to 'humanize',0
"its stories, making the economy and",0
business readable and,0
appealing to everybody.,0
Capital normally devotes one 5 to 6 page,0
story to a large company,0
which is in the news because of its,0
success (Or failure:),0
Mr: Wattez,0
is preparing such,0
on PM,0
as an,0
example of success:,0
He,0
has already,0
iehviestea _,0
"Walter Thoma (President, EC), Michael",1

Horst (EC) and,1
Viault (acobs Suchard),1
He has also seen PM,0

"Ms, Held:",0
As,0
"4 wholcsaler in Ilinois,",0
am very disturbed about the,0
Department of Health and,0
Human Services' (HHS) proposed mles,0
regarding the sale Of distribution of,0
tobacco,0
products to minors under Section 1926 of,0
the Fublic Health Service Act,0
would like to,0
take this opportunity to articulate some,0
of my concerns,0
"As y0u may knOw, the Ilinois state",0
legislature has already dealt,0
effectively with this issue,0
by attaching criminal penalties t0 the,0
sale Or distribution of tobacco products,0
to minors,0
Furthermore ; Letadlers; wholesalers and,0
other businesses in the State work very,0
hard to,0
ensure that,0
comply with the law:,0
Iam offended that HHS assumes we have,0
fallen,0
down On the job and has decided to take,0
matters into its,0
Ow,0
hands (without tbe consent,0
"of Congress) by proposing new, excessive",0
Tegulations,0
How does HHS propose tO pay for these,0
regulations?,0
On the backs of small businesses,0
and retailers who already carry a,0
tremendous regulatory burden,0
HHS estimates that the,0
proposed rules will cost S1SO million in,0
compliance law-enforcement costs,0
As,0
"understand it, HHS suggests that these",0
cOSts be passed onto retailers in tbe,0
form of,0
licensing fees_,0
These fees are unfair and could,0
potentially jeopardize the health of,0
Illinois' struggling small business,0
community.,0
"Finally,",0
strongly disagree with the use of,0
"children and ""private entities"" for law",0
enforcement purposes_,0
How can HHS suggest that young children,0
"bo used in ""sting""",0
operations that have them break the law?,0
It is not only counter-intuitive but it,0
is also,0
dangerous,0
"As for ""private entities"" ,",0
bave faitb that the law enforcement,0
offcials jn,0
Hlinois can do the job 0f enforcing the,0
laws,0
do not want t0 put that responsibility,0
in,0
the hands of private vigilantes:,0
Thank you for taking my comments into,0
account_,0
"Sincerely,",0

"your request, I am pleased to enclose a",0
copy of the explanatory materials sent,0
by,0
The Council for Tobacco Research to,0
potential principal investigators who,0
have,0
'inquired about support for their,0
research projects:,0
Those materials detail our two,0
step application process,0
The executive committee Of our,0
Scientific Advisory,0
Board first evaluates a Preliminary,0
Application and decides whether,0
or not to,0
encourage submission of,0
a Full Application_,0
Their decision is based not only on,0
scientific merit; but also on,0
appropriateness for,0
inclusion in one of the Councils,0
"multidisciplinary program areas, a5 well",0
as,0
recognition of current support Ievels,0
for similar projects:,0
This procedure takes,0
about two months,0
In order that your office has on hand,0
a reference set of Our Full Application,0
"forms, a sample copy is enclosed_",0
You 'will aIso find in this package our,0
Statement,0
"of Policy, Information for Applicants",0
and a recent Annual Report that lists,0
currently supported grants and contains,0
abstracts of papers that have appeared,0
over,0
the last year acknowledging support from,0

that,0
the,0

Clinical,0

Subsequent studies,0

The biologica],0
role of DHEA is,0
not,0

was demonstrated over 20,0

that DHEA,0
is,0

This,0

RE: CBS/8O Minutes,0
An update on & Board of Directors of,0
TITL meeting by telephona today:,0
A CBS praducer by the name of Rebecca,1
Peterson (sp?) located in the Washingion,1
oltice (202-973-0779) called,3
and asked to film at the TITL,0
Laboratory for a story they are planning,0
for Noverber cn Iow tar cigarettes,0
Both RUR and PM were in favor of letting,0
them come in and filmn Without giving an,0
interview while B&W and Lorr,0
were not in favor,0
The reason stated for not being in favor,0
was ihgt this was 60 Minuies and nothing,0
good could,0
"come from #;,",0
Further discussion resulted in the,0
tollowing action:,0
Mara Payne of RJR will telephone the,1
producer to acquire,0
more details of tho requested tilming,0
and rcport back to thc Board of,0
Directors early next wcek:,0
In any event;,0
there was strong sentirent that TITL not,0
"speak for the industry, however_",0
if indivdual Companjes wanted to grant,0
an interview_,0
were free ta do sO.,0
will provide you with more detaits as,0
receive them:,0
It would appear that we at PM need to,0
dec te if we are going,0
to grant an interview vrith this,0
producer,0
plan to proceed accordingly_,0

Re: Cigarette Marketing Standards Act,0
(CMSA),0
Dear Mr _,0
Andrcc:,0
Youhave contactedus in regard to,0
thelegality ofcertain cigarette,0
manufacturers' promotions,0
under the Cigarcttc Marketing Standards,0
Act (CMSA) This letter is in response to,0
that inquiry.,0
"As you are aware, the Departmnent issued",0
"TSB-M-0O (2JM on March 3, 2000 stating",0
that,0
certain manufacturers',0
"promotionalprograms known as ""buy-downs""",0
"and ""master-type"" programs",0
&re,0
prohbbited under CMSA. Please reference,0
that memorandum for details Itis the,0
Department s,0
view that any change with regard to,0
"""buy-downs",0
"and ""master-type"" programs would require",0
statulory change by the Legislaturc,0
Pursuant to longstanding interpretations,0
"of CMSA, the industry has offcred other",0
types of,0
"promotional programs, including",0
reductions,0
and  trade discounts provided for 0n the,0
manufacturer' $ invoice and,0
"one, get one free"" (or",0
sOme; get some (ree) promotions These,0
progran1s continue to be allowed under,0
"CMSA, provided (1) the trade discount o",0
price reduction,0
(including any,0
reduction due to free product) is,0
reflectedon the manufacturer's invoice;,0
(2) all,0
cigarette tax agents selling thc,0
manufacturer'$ brands in New- York State,0
are allowed to participate,0
in the prorolion; and (3) the promotion,0
is not limited to specified retail,0
dcalers (other than for,0
purposcs of proporlional allocation of,0
available supply of promotional product),0
The industry has,0
also offered manufacturcr's coupons,0
"These are allowable under CMSA, provided",0
that the coupon,0
is either published in < newspaper or,0
magazine of general circulation; or,0
mailed directly to {he,0

RE; 6' and &' OPM Conversion,0
As a reminder;,0
my recommendation is not to ship OPMs t0,0
retail accounts with a missing,0
panel in the OPM Our accounts and FSF,0
will be confused and we would,0
have just created,0
total chaos at field kevel_,0
"Additionally, by placing these items on",0
hold we are confronted with potential,0
rejected orders or,0
confusion as we are just beginning,0
new allocation process_,0
The plan we should be looking at is,0
establishing,0
a clear Game Plan & communications to,0
Madden and HUB agents collectively_,0
Harbor has about 100 message panels in,0
spare parts and plans to ship them to,0
Roselle on,0
Monday (Bulk): Secandly; Bob met with,0
"Mally, an prepares a PO for 3,000 +",0
(depending on,0
open orders from Stacey and projected,0
number at TPI ) Message panels for 6' &,0
8' OPMs_,0
Hub recaps to Madden the total number of,0
OPMs they have at each TPI depot that,0
needs to,0
be retrofitted.,0
A labor force is hired and is sent to,0
Roselle to open all 6' & 8' opms and,0
remove,0
clocks,0
and make one good OPM trom 2 OPMs,0
(marking each completed OPM with a,0
retrofitted,0
sticker);Additional panels would be,0
shipped from Roselle to TPI depots to,0
have agents retrofit,0
them PRIOR to the,0
they are to be installed. (Documentation,0
outline to follow),0
Once the production of the Panels are,0
completed from Harbor,0
are shipped to Roselle and,0
the remaining OPMs are made whole using,0
the hired labor force again:,0
know this is not the complete process,0
"flaw, but does present a solutian with",0
upsetting our,0
current process;,0

"research in his absence, re: a speech",0
he's preparing for GCB to be delivered,0
at Kraft,0
later this month,0
He's specifically interested in,0
discussing how the value af investment,0
in PM has,0
grown (source: maybe the last,0
shareholders' report),0
CAN YOU VERIFY that the,0
stock price has more than tripled in the,0
1990s?,0
AND; is there any documentation,0
showing how much the value of investment,0
in PM has grown (eg:,0
in The New York,0
Times tnis week; there was an article,0
talking about the,0
"Jones stocks, how",0
much certain ones are worth now based on,0
investment in them,0

5235m cost,0
avoidance,0
in,0
1992,0
and,0
is explained,0
below.,0
S46m was spent with,0
TRACKER in,0
91,0
for diary,0
panel,0
recruitment _,0
On,0
a cost/complete,0
basis,0
this,0
cost,0
was,0
more than,0
what,0
we,0
d,0
MARC,0
for,0
smoker recrui-,0
through,0
SRMS _,0
When questioned,0
about,0
this,0
discrepancy,0
MARC,0
attributed this,0
cost,0
di,0
fference to,0
the,0
different markups,0
each group in MARC,0
used _,0
MARC,0
has,0
standardized,0
this markup,0
and,0
the,0
pr,0
was reduced,0
to $23m.,0
Instead,0
of,0
reducing the cost of,0
Tracker,0
"by S23m,",0
we,0
asked,0
TRACKER,0
to,0
use,0
this money to recruit,0
as many,0
smokers,0
as possible due,0
to,0
the,0
cost/complete with,0
the,0
new price,0
This has,0
resulted,0
in,0
doub],0
the number of smokers recruited .,0
We also made,0
procedura/ change in,0
how these,0
smokers,0
are used_,0
Instead of,0
these,0
smokers,0
directly,0
into,0
the diary pane],0
the,0
smokers will,0
now be placed,0
in the SRMS,0
and a)ocated,0
where,0
they,0
can provide the greatest,0
benefit_,0
For,0
"example,",0
an 18-24 year,0
old Marlboro,0
smoker,0
to,0
a CAMEL product test_,0
This will allow US,0
to maximize,0
savings,0
for the company,0
(5235m estimated,0
in 1992),0
through the,0
most efficient allocation of,0
resources,0

I does not do much to,0
improve the scientific image of our,0
company.,0
"However, there",0
is every reason to believe it is,0
Scientificallly accurate.,0
As with many publications_,0
title promises more than i8-,0
delivered' ini the paper.,0
The title leads one to expect to lear,0
what the effects of the properties of',0
carbon,0
on cigarette,0
smoke filtered through carbon.,0
The major prtion of the paper,0
deals with & description Of the,0
properties of carbon with only,0
limited information on the effect of,0
charcoal on cigarette smoke,0
(analysis of cysteine),0
In,0
"addition, it is not clear what speciiic",0
type of' charcoal was the final subject,0
of their study_,0
A major weak point relates to tables,0
1.and 2.,0
The last entries,0
in these tables refer to the heat of,0
absorption of the two char-,0
coals studied.,0
The,0
figures reflect results from,0
different,0
methods of measurement _,0
The results differ significantly to,0
which only a passing reference: is made.,0
There should be an explanation or at,0
least speculation as to,0
these figures differ,0
Ibelieve the authors in other work on,0
heat,0
1,0
of absorption of charcoal have made,0
direct calorimetric measure-,0
ments _,0
Reference could be made to this point,0
and results from,0
such studies used to explain the,0
differences in the tabulated,0
measurements_,0
